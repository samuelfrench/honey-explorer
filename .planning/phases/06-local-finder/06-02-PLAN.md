# Plan 06-02: Producer Profiles and List View

## Goal
Build producer profile detail pages with hero photos, visual story format, and enhanced list view with large producer photos.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Producer profile page with hero image and story format
- [ ] List view shows large producer photos with quick-glance info
- [ ] Filter sidebar for source type with visual icons
- [ ] Contact info with click-to-call and map directions
- [ ] Social media links with icons

## Tasks

### Backend Enhancements
1. Add slug field to LocalSource for SEO-friendly URLs:
   - Migration to add slug column
   - Generate slug from name on seed/create
   - Repository method: `findBySlug`

2. Enhance LocalSourceDto with:
   - Parsed hours object (from JSON)
   - Formatted phone number
   - Social media links array

### Producer Profile Page
1. Create `ProducerDetailPage`:
   - Full-width hero image header
   - Name and type badge overlay
   - Description in story format

2. Info sections:
   - Location card with embedded mini-map
   - Hours card with today's status (Open/Closed)
   - Contact card with phone, email, website
   - Social media buttons

3. Add call-to-action buttons:
   - "Get Directions" (opens Google Maps)
   - "Call" (click-to-call on mobile)
   - "Visit Website" (opens in new tab)

### List View Enhancement
1. Create `SourceCard` component:
   - Large thumbnail (16:9 aspect)
   - Name, type badge, city/state
   - Distance if searching by location
   - Open/Closed status badge

2. Create `FilterSidebar` for sources:
   - Source type checkboxes with icons
   - State/region dropdown
   - "Open Now" toggle

3. Responsive layout:
   - Desktop: 3-column grid
   - Tablet: 2-column grid
   - Mobile: Single column or horizontal scroll

### Navigation
1. Add "Local Sources" to main nav
2. Add breadcrumbs to profile page
3. Add "Back to Map" quick link

## Implementation Notes
- Slug generation: lowercase, hyphenated, remove special chars
- Hours parsing: Parse JSON to show "Open until 5pm" or "Closed - Opens 9am"
- Mini-map on profile: Small static Leaflet map with single marker
