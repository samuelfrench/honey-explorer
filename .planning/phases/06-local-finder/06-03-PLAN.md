# Plan 06-03: Events Calendar and Homepage Carousel

## Goal
Create visual events calendar for honey-related events and prominently feature upcoming events in a homepage carousel.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Events data model with date, location, image
- [ ] Events calendar with visual cards (not plain list)
- [ ] Homepage events carousel with auto-scroll
- [ ] Event detail modal or page
- [ ] Filter events by type and location

## Tasks

### Backend - Events Data Model
1. Create `Event` entity:
   - name, description, eventType
   - startDate, endDate
   - location (address, city, state, lat/lng)
   - imageUrl, thumbnailUrl
   - link (external URL)
   - localSourceId (optional, if hosted by a source)

2. Create `EventType` enum:
   - FESTIVAL, MARKET, CLASS, TASTING, TOUR, FAIR

3. Create `EventRepository` with:
   - `findUpcoming()` - Future events ordered by date
   - `findByMonth(year, month)` - For calendar view
   - `findByType()` - Filter by event type

4. Create `EventController`:
   - `GET /api/events` - List upcoming
   - `GET /api/events/calendar` - Calendar data
   - `GET /api/events/{id}` - Single event

5. Seed initial events data:
   - 10-15 sample events across different types
   - Mix of festivals, markets, classes, tastings

### Frontend - Events Calendar
1. Create `EventsPage`:
   - Calendar view (month grid) on desktop
   - List view on mobile
   - Toggle between views

2. Create calendar components:
   - `EventCalendar` - Month grid with event dots
   - `EventCard` - Visual card for list view
   - `EventModal` - Detail popup on click

3. Event filtering:
   - Type filter with icons
   - Location/region filter
   - Date range picker

### Frontend - Homepage Carousel
1. Create `EventsCarousel` component:
   - Horizontal scroll on mobile
   - 3-card view on desktop
   - Auto-scroll every 5 seconds
   - Pause on hover

2. Add to homepage:
   - Section title: "Upcoming Events"
   - "View All" link to events page
   - Show next 6 upcoming events

### Navigation
1. Add "Events" to main nav
2. Link events to their host local sources

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing date-fns for date formatting
- Calendar grid: CSS Grid with 7 columns
- Carousel: CSS scroll-snap or simple state-based
- Sample events: Honey festivals, bee keeping classes, farmers markets
