## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Visual-first approach prioritized throughout - large imagery, Pinterest/Instagram aesthetic
- [Roadmap]: Data seeding as Phase 3 to prevent cold start problem (200+ honeys, 50+ local sources)
- [Roadmap]: Events carousel must be prominently featured on homepage (Phase 6)
- [01-01]: Installed SDKMAN for Java 21 and Maven management (no sudo required)
- [01-01]: Used Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin for CSS-first configuration
- [01-01]: Health endpoint returns JSON with status and ISO timestamp

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Cold start is critical risk - Phase 3 data seeding must be thorough
- AI content needs human-in-the-loop to avoid Google penalties
- Local source data decays - verification metadata built into schema
